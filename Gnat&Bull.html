                                <p>A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting there for a considerable time.</p>
                                <p>When it had rested sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the Bull, “Do you mind if I go now?” The Bull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, “It’s all one to me; I didn’t notice when you came, and I shan’t know when you go away.”</p>
                                <p>We may often be of more consequence in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbours.</p>

                                <p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
                                <p>Partially, but it also obeys your commands. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
                                <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? <strong> I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</strong> <em> Leave that to me.</em> Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
                                <p>What!? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
                                <p>Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I'm trying not to, kid. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
                                <blockquote><p>I call it luck. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</p></blockquote>
