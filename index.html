            <h1>THE GNAT & THE BULL</h1>
                <h3>in Fables, by Aesop, 15 March 2021</h3>
                    <p>A Gnat alighted on one of the horns of a Bull, and remained sitting there for a considerable time. 
                    When it had rested sufficiently and was about to fly away, it said to the Bull, “Do you mind if I go now?” The Bull merely raised his eyes and remarked, without interest, “It’s all one to me; I didn’t notice when you came, and I shan’t know when you go away.” 
                    We may often be of more consequence in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbours.

            <h1>THE FOX & THE GRAPES</h1>
                <h3>in Fables, by Aesop, 13 March 2021</h3>
                    <p>A hungry Fox saw some fine bunches of Grapes hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by jumping as high as he could into the air. But it was all in vain, for they were just out of reach: so he gave up trying, and walked away with an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, “I thought those Grapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour.”</p>

            <h1>THE WOLVES, THE SHEEP AND THE RAM</h1> 
                <h3>in Fables, by Aesop, 11 March 2021</h3>    
                    <p>The Wolves sent a deputation to the Sheep with proposals for a lasting peace between them, on condition of their giving up the sheep-dogs to instant death. The foolish Sheep agreed to the terms; but an old Ram, whose years had brought him wisdom, interfered and said, "How can we expect to live at peace with you? Why, even with the dogs at hand to protect us, we are never secure from your murderous attacks!"</p>
