                                <p>The Wolves sent a deputation to the Sheep with proposals for a lasting peace between them, on condition of their giving up the sheep-dogs to instant death. </p>
                                <p>The foolish Sheep agreed to the terms; but an old Ram, whose years had brought him wisdom, interfered and said, "How can we expect to live at peace with you? Why, even with the dogs at hand to protect us, we are never secure from your murderous attacks!"</p>

                                <h2>Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</h2>
                                    <p>As you wish. He is here. You mean it controls your actions? All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? You don't believe in the Force, do you? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
                                <h3>I'm trying not to, kid.</h3>
                                    <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
                                    <p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>
                                    <blockquote><p>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p></blockquote>
                                    <p>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
